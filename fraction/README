== Description ==
The design and implementation of fraction. This implementation of fraction supports any fraction with numerator and denominator fit in 'long long' integer type in C++.

In this implementation, a fraction is automatically simplified when it is created or modified. A defined exception will be thrown when
a. trying to initiate a fraction with denominator = 0.
b. trying to call set on denominator to set it to 0.
c. trying to divide another fraction whose actual value is 0.

== Installation ==
Requirements: 
G++ compliler supporting C++11 standard

Compilation:
Use command 'make' in the current directory
